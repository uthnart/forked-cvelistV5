An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a crafted link or by sending crafted requests to the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user such as deleting users from the device, accessing password or log files, or uploading and deleting existing files from the system.\r\n\r    \r\n\r For more information about these vulnerabilities, see the Details [\"#details\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r  {{value}} [\"%7b%7bvalue%7d%7d\"])}]]"
