In versions of Sealos prior to 4.2.0 an improper configuration of role based access control (RBAC) permissions resulted in an attacker being able to obtain cluster control permissions, which could control the entire cluster deployed with Sealos, as well as hundreds of pods and other resources within the cluster. This issue has been addressed in version 4.2.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability."
