/**
 *  This is the Delta class.  A delta is a list of files in a directory whose content changed from time T1 to T2.
 *  Changes can be a new added file, updated file, or deleted file (though currently, we do not work with deleted
 *  files since no CVEs should ever be deleted once it is published).
 *
 *  Note that this class REQUIRES git and a git history.  It does not look at files, only git commits in git history.
 *  So during testing, simply copying /cves from another directory WILL NOT WORK because git history
 *  does not have those commits.
 *
 *  When making zip files, this class copies CVE JSON files from /cves to a directory, and zip that, so the /cves directory
 *  needs to be in the current directory
